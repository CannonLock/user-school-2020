Wednesday Exercise 4.3: Python Extras
===========================================

If you have time, try exploring the following problems: 

Arguments
---------

Similar to what was shown in a [previous exercise](/materials/day2/part3-ex5/arguments), 
can you modify your submit file and shell script so that the number provided to the `fib.py` script is an argument from the submit file? 

Multiple Jobs
-------------

Given this list of numbers:

	:::file
	0
	25
	80
	110
	250
	3000

Can you submit a job for each number? 

Packages
--------

We haven't talked about adding Python packages (like `numpy` or `matplotlib`) to the Python installation. Where would that go in the installation process? Try creating a Python installation that includes the `numpy` package.
