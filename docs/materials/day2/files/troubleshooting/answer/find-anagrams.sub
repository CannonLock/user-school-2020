# SOLUTION
# ========
# Problem:
#    Job fails to submit
#
# Where to find more info:
#    In the condor_submit failure message, "Executable file
#    find_anagrams.py is a script with CRLF (DOS/Win) line endings"
#
# Solution:
#    Convert the file using `dos2unix find_anagrams.py`

executable = find_anagrams.py
arguments = p098_words.txt

# SOLUTION
# ========
# Problem:
#    Jobs complete successfully without output
#
# Where to find more info:
#    condor_q will show that your job has completed but 'ls' will show
#    no new files in the directory
#
# Solution:
#    Specify 'output'. It's always a good idea to also specify 'error'
#    and 'log'!

output = find-anagrams.out
error = find-anagrams.err
log = find-anagrams.log

# SOLUTION
# ========
# Problem:
#    Job remains idle indefinitely
#
# Where to find more info:
#    condor_q -better <job ID> -> requested too much memory
#
# Solution:
#    1. `condor_rm` the job and remove the 'request_memory' line.
#    2. `condor_submit` find-anagrams.sub
#    3. Set 'request_memory' and resubmit the job
#       (100MB is a safe default starting point.)
#
#    Alternatively, use `condor_qedit <JOB ID> RequestMemory 100`

request_memory = 100MB

# SOLUTION
# ========
# Problem:
#    Job is held due to a typo in transfer_input_files
#
# Where to find more info:
#    condor_q -held -> hold reason
#
# Solution:
#   Refer to the correct input filename in transfer_input_files

transfer_input_files = p098_words.txt

# SOLUTION
# ========
# Problem:
