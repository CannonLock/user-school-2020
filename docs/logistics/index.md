## General Information About the School Schedule

### Travel Schedule

For planning your trip:

- **Arrive on Sunday, July 14, 2019,** prior to 6 p.m. (if possible).  Classes begin on Monday morning, but there is a
  welcome dinner on Sunday evening for all participants (including instructors).  This is a nice way to get to know each
  other and to start the week.

<!-- -->

- **Depart on Saturday, July 20, 2019,** any time.  The School ends with another dinner on Friday evening, so it is best
  to stay that night.

If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will pay for the six nights of this schedule.

### School Hours

The School is Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to about 5:00 p.m.; the lecture hall doors open at about 8:00 a.m. for
breakfast, and there will be optional work sessions on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings.  A detailed schedule will
be available before the School begins.
