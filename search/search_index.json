Through lectures, discussions, and \nlots of hands-on activities\n with experienced OSG staff,\nyou will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific\ncomputing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help.  Take a look at \nthe high-level curriculum and\nsyllabus\n for more details.\n\n\nThe school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part\nof the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students,\nfaculty, and staff.  Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs\nassociated with the School.\n\n\nApplications\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe plan to start accepting applications in the first part of March, so check back soon for more details.\n\n\nContact Us\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe OSG User School is part of the \nOSG Outreach Area\n\u00a0\u2014 please visit\nthat site to learn about other OSG Outreach activities.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about the School, the application process, or anything else, feel free to email us:\n\n\nuser-school@opensciencegrid.org\n\n\n   \n   OSGUserSchool",
